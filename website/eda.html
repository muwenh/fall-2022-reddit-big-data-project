              <p>In the exploratory data analysis, we focus our analysis on two parts: Pokémon related subreddits and people's discussion of popular Pokémon. The top 5 Pokémon subreddits shown in Figure 1 occupy more than 60% of Pokémon submissions, so our analysis will focus on the top 5 subreddits. Because of unique features of Pokémon Go, it become the most popular Pokémon products for last two years. We also realized that some events like annual Pokémon Present in February and release of new games can significantly increase popularity of subreddits. Active users are important for Pokémon community. Some users like “GoroMajimaIsMyIdol” and “Mx_Toniy_4869” are high quality creators. We think cooperating with them may create business values for The Pokémon Company. Then, we analyze the most important product of Pokémon IP which is Pokémon game. The popularities of recent four Pokémon games are influenced by certain events like in-game activities or release of new information. For the conclusion, our exploratory data analysis successfully achieves our business goals. In the next milestone, we will analyze people’s sentiments in subreddits and investigate how sentiments are affected by events we identified in EDA.</p>

              <p>Another important part of Pokémon is people’s discussion about popular Pokémon. We want to find out what Pokémon can receive people’s preference and why they are more popular than others. Charizard, Pikachu and Eevee are top three popular Pokémon. We think the success of Charizard and Pikachu can be attributed to their long history in Pokémon anime and the popularity of Eevee is mainly due to its cute appearance. We also analyze Legendary Pokémon and Weather Trio is the most popular one. Legendary Pokémon is closely connected to game storylines, so their popularity is greatly influenced by the corresponding games. At last, we analyze deeply into the most special Pokémon Eevee which has eight different evolutions. Umbreon and Sylveon are top two popular evolution forms and their popularity is reflected on their high trading card prices. In conclusion, the current exploratory analysis tells us the overall popularity of Pokémon. In the future milestones, we will further analyze popular Pokémon by studying sentiments received by these Pokémon.</p>

            <p>The graph shows that pokemongo has the highest number of submissions. Indicating that it is the most popular subreddit among all subreddits related to Pokémon. Subreddit pokemon is the second most popular subreddit among all Pokémon related subreddits. The result suggests that Pokémon Go remains incredibly popular. The product is probably the most successful product derived from the IP of all time. In a business sense, a deeper dive into its logic is critical and lessons can be learned from the unprecedented success. Pokémon Go introduces customizable options, brings in social connections to the experience, and provides simple UI backed by advanced technology such as AR. That makes it accessible to a larger audience than traditional mobile games. In conclusion, the unique features of Pokemon Go largely influence its performance.</p>

          <tr>
            <p>The graph below shows top 10 authors that receive largest number of comments in top 3 Pokémon subreddits. However, from the perspective of the number of comments, it's hard to conclude if these authors are high-quality content creators and have high commercial values. Some authors may publish controversial contents and receive a lot of comments. To determine if they are high-quality content creators, we implement further analysis by identifying their active subreddits. GoroMajimaIsMyIdol and princegb are active in pokemontrades subreddit. Other three authors, Mx_Toniy_4869, Smeaglemehappy_33 and Justamation are active on pokemon subreddits. <strong>First</strong>, GoroMajimaIsMyIdol is active in PokemonTrades and Pokémon GTS (global trading system). The author's most popular submission <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/t9juri/100_female_rngd_shinies_for_international_womens/">100 Female RNG'd Shinies for International Women's Day! ♀️</a>️ is to celebrate International Women days by randomly choosing 100 commenters to give away a shiny female Pokémon. The author has held a lot of events to give away Pokémon for free and help other people to complete their Pokémon collections. <strong>Second</strong>, the author princegb also gives away a lot of Pokémon with hidden ability. The author holds more than one hundred giveaways, sending thousands of Pokémon to other players. This author is a very active user in Pokémon GTS and is enthusiastic to help other players. <strong>Third</strong>, Mx_Toniy_4869 posts obscure but fun Pokémon fact and receives a lot of comments. At the time this analysis is written, the author has already published more than 300 obscure facts. He shows very deep and comprehensive understanding of Pokémon history and Pokémon knowledge. We think cooperating with this author may be beneficial for The Pokémon Company. One idea is to release some unknown information to the author to arise people's attention in certain Pokémon topic. The Pokémon Company can consider this as an advertisement tool in social media. <strong>Fourth</strong>, the author Smeaglemehappy_33 published two submissions that receive a large amount of comments: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/x00f4f/your_one_true_partner_pokemon_based_on_your/">Your One True Partner Pokemon (Based On Your Username)</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/wu4u0t/give_me_a_pokemon_and_ill_tell_you_how_they_would/">Give me a Pokemon and I’ll tell you how they would be useful in the real world</a>. However, the author's other submissions don't receive much attention compared to the top 2. We think this author luckily created two very popular submissions. The Pokémon company can investigate these posts to study what topics arise people's attention, but we don’t think it's necessary to cooperate with this author. <strong>Last</strong>, the submission receiving highest comments of Justamation is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/qvqev1/found_something_similar_to_this_yesterday_so_i/">Found something similar to this yesterday, so i want to try do it also</a>. However, this submission is removed by moderators. We don't know the specific reason of removal, but this submission is considered as a violation to Pokémon community. Therefore, the author cannot be considered as high-quality content creators and do not have high commercial value. We do not recommend The Pokémon Company to cooperate with this author. In conclusion, we think authors including GoroMajimaIsMyIdol, princegb and Mx_Toniy_4869 may be beneficial to cooperate with, but the rest two authors don't have commercial values.</p>

As the earliest released of the four games, this game has completed player accumulation. The overall user stickiness is high, and the game has good social attributes. Players are willing to discuss it on the reddit.
Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl (BDSP) is also widely discussed in the 2021 Pokémon day. The second discussion peak occurred in the middle of November, when the game was officially launched on the switch and brought about continuous high participation activities. In celebration of the release of these games on Nintendo Switch, Pokémon originally discovered in the Sinnoh region will be appearing more often in Pokémon GO. Turtwig, Chimchar, and Piplup wearing special Sinnoh-inspired hats will be appearing in the wild, and avatar items inspired by those same first partner Pokémon will be available in the shop. Pokémon Legends: Arceus is also widely discussed in the 2021 Pokémon day. The second discussion peak occurred on January 28th which is the official release date for Pokémon Legends: Arceus on Nintendo Switch. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet will be officially released on November 18, 2022. The first time players know about this game is on February 27, 2022. The following high discussion volume also came from the release of new information on June 1 and August 3. Players will be able to “explore an open world where various towns with no borders blend seamlessly into the wilderness.” Pokémon will appear in the skies, in the sea, and on the streets in the game world which can bring special experience to players.</p>

            <p>Charizard is the Pokémon which receive the largest number of comments. Charizard is the ace Pokémon of protagonist named Ash in the first Pokémon anime series. Its cool appearance and strong performance in anime gave people very impressive memory. The popularity of Charizard last for decades and at current day, it's still the most popular Pokémon in social media. The second and third popular Pokémon are Pikachu and Eevee. Pikachu is the most well-known Pokémon in the world and is the iconic face of Pokémon franchise. The success of Pikachu is the result of long-time investment by The Pokémon Company. In 1997, Pikachu was chosen as the partner of protagonist Ash. After 25 years and more than 1200 episodes, Pikachu become the most-seen Pokémon to fans and has strong emotional connection to Pokémon lovers. After the success of Pikachu, The Pokémon Company attempts to create another iconic face of Pokémon universe and their choice is Eevee. Eevee is the most special Pokémon which has 8 different types of evolutions. In 2018, The Pokémon Company released two Pokémon games: Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! In these games, player start with Pikachu or Eevee and they always sit on player character's shoulder in the overworld. This game further increased the popularity of Eevee. Due to specialty of Eevee, we will conduct further analysis about it. In addition of normal Pokémon shown above, we want to further investigate popularity of Legendary Pokémon. According to Pokémon Wiki, "Legendary Pokémon (伝説でんせつのポケモン, Pokémon of Legends), or Pokémon Illusions (幻まぼろしのポケモン, Phantom Pokémon) are extremely rare and often very powerful Pokémon that are often associated with legends of creation and/or destruction within their endemic regions". Legendary Pokémon is closely related to storyline in every Pokémon game and should receive a lot of attention in Reddit. The Weather Trio receive highest number of comments. The Weather Trio includes Kyogre, Groudon and Rayquaza which were first introduced in Pokémon Sapphire, Ruby, and Emerald in 2004. In the storyline of these games, the battle between Kyogre and Groudon causes huge disaster to the Pokémon world and Rayquaza mediates the battle. This was the first time Pokémon players saw battle between Legendary Pokémon which left very impressive memory to them. About 20 years later, Weather Trio still has the highest popularity among all Legendary Pokémon. </p>

              <p>The three most discussed Eevee evolutionary forms are the Umbreon, Sylveon, and Espeon. Each Eevee evolution form has different evolution condition which brings a lot of interesting experience to game players.
